<h1>Domino's Stock Price Analysis</h1>
<p>This project conducts analysis on a dataset containing Domino's Stock price data using the Python programming language and the popular library Pandas. The analysis explores various aspects of the stock, such as trading volume, stock price trends, returns, and potential patterns or clusters in stock price movements over time.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Due to the project being completed using Jupyter Notebook, there is no need to install my project on your machine. If you want to explore the code and its outputs more in-depth click on Domino's Stock Price Analysis.ipynb file in the repository and there you can find code blocks with their outputs.</p>

```
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
